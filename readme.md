** GIPHY CHALLENGE

In this exercise, we created an app that dynamically creates buttons after a user input, renders button from an origin array in the script, and is able to load from the Giphy API 10 images per request. 

Upon click, the GIF will either change it's state from animated to still, and will display image behavior appropriately.
